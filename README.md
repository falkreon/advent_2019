 # Advent of Code 2019

 Advent of Code happens over here -  https://adventofcode.com/2019


 This is the first time I've participated; normally I'm over in Ludum Dare, but the time worked
 out just perfectly for me to participate this year. My code will probably be a little messy -
 hard-coded data files and whatnot - my main objective is to kick around some java 10 and 11
 features just so I'm more used to them when I inevitably find myself on a java 11 project.


 All code is MIT - so if you get stuck somewhere in the calendar, feel free to peek in on my solutions.
 They're split into days so you can stay spoiler-free on other problems.
